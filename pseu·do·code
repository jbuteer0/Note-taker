Things already have:index.html,package json,journal json,
note.html,css style and javascrit code as part of front-end.

Things i will do : Build a full back-end functionallity.
1) HTML routes in js node: a) Get/notes that will return
the notes.html file.
2) Get/index should return the index.html file

Create db.json file to store and strieve notes
from html user using (fs) module.

Use GET /api/notes to read the db.json file and return all saved data as jso.

Use POST /api/notes to receive a new note,save to the request user
then add it to the db.json file and return the data to the clients.

Finally use DELETE /api/notes/:id means give a unique id to every note  after being saved.
